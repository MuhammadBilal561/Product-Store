This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


🚀 Excited to launch my first Full-Stack Web Application! 🎉
I built and deployed this project using Next.js (frontend) + Node.js & Express.js (backend) + MongoDB (database), and hosted it live on Vercel 🌐.
Source code is open for everyone on GitHub 📂.

💡 What this application does:
It’s an online product store where users can:

🛒 Browse Products – See all available products in a clean, responsive layout.

🔍 View Details – Click on any product to see full details like price, description, and image.

🗄 Data Management – Products are stored securely in a database for reliability.

⚡ Fast & Responsive – Works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

🛠 Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS (for fast, responsive UI)

Backend: Node.js + Express.js (API & server logic)

Database: MongoDB (secure storage)

Deployment: Vercel (live hosting)

This project taught me:

How to connect a backend and frontend efficiently 🔗

Deploying applications for the public to use 🌐

Building a real-world, user-friendly web app 🚀

Feeling proud of this milestone and looking forward to building more advanced projects ahead! 🙌

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
